# Multimodal Fusion With Unorthodox Inputs

This repository contains 2 new models I've created:

- Graph Attention LSTM (An LSTM version of the Graph Attention Layer proposed in [Graph Attention Networks (Veličković et al., ICLR 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903))
- Multimodal Graph and Image Comprehension model (A multimodal fusion that interprets graph and image data in conjunction)
